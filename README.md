THIS IS A VERY BASIC DAPP

GM frens, this is my first attempt at a "dApp", and combining a smart contract with a basic front-end.

I have used HTML to provide the front-end, and I have not done any styling, as this is simply a proof of concept and a project for me to gain experience. There will be better projects in the future, as I progress in my learning. 

This dApp allows users to "set the mood" of a smart contract that is deployed on the Ropsten TestNet.
